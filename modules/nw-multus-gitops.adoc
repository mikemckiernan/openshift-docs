= Multiple networks and GitOps

Typically, managing an additional network is performed imperatively by editing the `cluster` object for the Cluster Network Operator with the `oc edit networks.operator.openshift.io cluster` command and adding a `.spec.additionalNetworks` field.

To support GitOps, the best practice is to begin by creating a network attachment definition object instead of modifying the `cluster` object.

== Limitations

* After you add a network attachment definition and a pod uses the network attachment, modifying the network attachment definition does not trigger the pod to restart. As a result, the pod continues to run with the previous definition.
